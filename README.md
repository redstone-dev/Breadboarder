# Breadboarder
Create and visualize breadboards easily. 

### Installation
> Note: Python 3.9 is recommended.

Just `git clone` it from the repo I guess, or click the Download Code button and then unzip it.
Then, you'll need to create a `BreadboardMaker` directory inside the directory where `main.py` is, with a directory called `outputs` inside it. This is used for generating text-file outputs when you use the `::show` command. After that, you can happily use `python3` on `main.py` and run the program with that.

### Commands
Oh, did I say "command"? Yeah, this thing has some commands. Not a full parser, but it has them. Just put "0" for the row number, and type a command. Use `::cmds` to see all commands.

### Configuration
If you need to configure anything, edit the dictionary in `config.py` called `config`. See the wiki for more details on what everything does there.
